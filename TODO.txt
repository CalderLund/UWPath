TODO: *Start from Faculty of Math then expand (IGNORE SOFTWARE ENGINEERING)
- Functionality incorrect: CS 146 or a grade of 60% or higher in CS 136 or 138 (lack of "one of")
- remove inefficiencies in Requirements.py with calling same loop multiple times
- add Antireq class
- create database for prereqs and antireqs
- parse majors, minors, options, etc. from urls like http://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/printable/11685
    - Then expand to automate parsing of all other pages (potentially using selenium)
- parse list of all acdemic plans for math (Plans Table)
- Organize documents into relevant directories before project becomes too large
- document CourseParser.py
- document Database.py
- add parsing functionality for additional subjects
- make nicer README
- In the future add different course calender years for academic plans (up to 5 years in history)
- Add enrollment difficulty to each course (potential to evaluate a schedule for feasibility)
